This is the Admin Dashboard assignment from the Odin Project.

Thoughts on the project:
  Thanks to some good instruction, I would consider this to be the easiest final project thus far. 
  I used grid for the vast majority of my positioning. However, I did find I needed to use flexbox
  as well, especially when I wanted to put text on the bottom of its container.

  While I did not find this particualar project challenging, I did find it very enjoyable. First, it's
  very satisfying putting all the puzzle pieces together and watching your project come into being. Secondly,
  there were multiple instances where I needed to use divs themselves as visual pieces to the project. Rather
  than just containers, they became art pieces, and the page becomes not just a place of information, but an
  admittedly simple work of art.
